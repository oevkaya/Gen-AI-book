# Preface {.unnumbered}

Although the history of AI tools is old, the potential impact of Gen-AI may be huge for various sectors. The current form of these tools has the real potential to transform the way we live and work, regardless of whether we like it or not. As a matter of fact, we started to hear various news about their potential use cases in diverse fields, including the Mayo Clinic research hospital, which tries to implement Google's medical AI chatbot, or Harvard University which announced the new version of the online Computer Science (CS50) having a new teacher bot feature. In the meantime, there are various opposite thoughts about the rise of AI-powered tools, including those who think that this is the beginning of Artificial general Intelligence (AGI) or that these tools are nowhere near as mind-blowing as they presume.

In the last year, the initial reactions from the higher education community were mixed, including certain banning intentions across different countries. Mainly, one of the main concerns has been the potential for students to use such tools to cheat and generate unauthentic works, having big impacts on their integrity, whereas we all know that this is not a new problem indeed. A more critical concern is the possibility of over-reliance on generated outputs, which hinders the capacity to think independently or detect incorrect output from Gen-AI tools. Furthermore, the use of such tools raises a number of ethical concerns, such as the propagation of bias in the generated content and the disclosure of personal information to the operating companies. As the use of Gen-AI could have a profound impact, it is becoming increasingly vital for students and faculty to comprehend the capabilities and limitations of these systems.

In the light of all of these,
